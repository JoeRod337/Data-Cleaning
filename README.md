# ***Data-Cleaning In MySQL***

Demonstrating data cleaning using MySQL using WorldLifeExpectancy.csv.


### ***Project Overview***

For this project, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to clean a dataset in MySQL.  The following will show that I understand how to clean data by searching for duplicates and removing them.  I will also show that I can make corrections that fill in blank or null data with appropriate data.  I will also show that I understand working with data and the need to keep a control dataset to compare to when updating information in the dataset.


### ***Data***

The data used for this project is “WorldLifeExpectancy.csv” file.  This dataset contains information for developing and developed nations around the world.  The dataset contains information spanning from 2007 – 2022.
